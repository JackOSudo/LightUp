# LightUp
This is mostly just a proof of concept and to get my coding skills better, so unless it does well i will not support it much.

Light Up is a project involving three things, viewers, buyers, and an LED sign.
A 24/7 livestream (hopefully) will go on and people can buy 1-hour time slots
and have their (64x64) image displayed on the livestream. They can advertise,
joke around and prank people by getting a timeslot.

This project involves, monetary transactions, backend and frontend chit chat,
CSS, a bunch of randos (hopefully including you) supporting this, and a ton of
googling.

if you want to be cool and try it out without using your website then look at the API folder.

ye idk what else to say.
